Grove is a git hosting application designed for developers, as opposed to developers who also want to maintain complicated development and publication repositories and websites.

Its basic premise is this. Though the vast majority of git workflow invovles maintaining a central repository, which acts as a combination repository and deployment center, to which all project members commit and from which they retrieve updates. As long as that repository is available and updated by all project members reliably, that approach is fine.

Grove provides a way for developers to *easily* use git to share code directly, without a server in the middle. It is git itself that allows this to happen, but Grove provides a framework for people to browse and view repositories, as well as to clone them via http.
