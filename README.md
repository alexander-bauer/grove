Grove is a git hosting application that allows developers to share their local repositories directly with other developers, without needing to push them to a central server. This is all accomplished through a basic web interface, and invocations of the git-http-backend, which comes prepackaged in git distributions.

This use of the very efficient git http capabilities allows developers to utilize the true peer to peer abilities of git, and share cutting-edge changes long even before they've reached the main server.

This sort of workflow, in which project members collaborate directly with other members, is one of many encouraged on [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/about/distributed). It ties development groups much closer together, and gives all members access to the most absolutely recent versions of branches.

## To Use
*Note: Grove is in alpha. It has (since v0.3.2) succeeded in its basic goal: to allow developers to share git repositories via http. Despite that, it is likely not suitable for general use.*
